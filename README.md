A sample react assignment. Feel free to fork, copy and modify as needed.

## Example

See https://clenemt.github.io/usabilla-assignment/ for a look at the code live. :rocket:

## How to

To run the sample locally, do the following:

```sh
npm install
npm run start
```

It will install dependencies, build the `docs/` folder and launch a small server at [localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000).

## Explanation

It only runs **thanks to**:

* [webpack-dev-server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server) for the simple http server
* [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) for the promise based HTTP client
* [store.js](http://fusejs.io/) for the Cross-browser storage API
* [fuse.js](https://github.com/marcuswestin/store.js/) for the fuzzy-search library


## Guidelines

* [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) is used for style consistencies in all files
* [ESlint](http://eslint.org/) is used for linting the `.js` files
* [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/) is used to enforce correct spacings on all files
* The above is **enforced when you try to commit**
* Commits should be in the form of:

```

# ‚úÖ Add unit test for inputs
```
